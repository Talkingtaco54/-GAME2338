Game Testing Concepts
Bungie's Approach to Testing Halo 3

"You can never test enough."

-Harold Ryan, Studio Manager for halo 3

The crew of Halo 3 doucment the various forms of testing they had to do to make Halo 3 as great a game as it was.

Function Testing
The team used function testing to check that the weapons were working properly when the action command on the controller was triggered. The team also used function testing to make sure spawns worked properly, various types of combat, etc. The team also brought in outsiders to play the game to gather crucial information on what is working and not working with the game to user partnership.

Automated Testing
The team utilized this form of testing to check things like jumping 1000 times in a row in the same spot to see if that would break the game. Clearly a test like this is better done automated since it would be a huge time consuming test to have someone manually do it. There were numerous tasks where automated testing speed up the bug solving abilities of the team.

Regression Testing
The team makes a comment about adding new lines of code and "make damn sure what you're doing is not completly breaking things." The team needs to make sure with every new line of code they add that it doesn't destroy the previous version of the build.

Stress Testing
The team used stress testing to check the limit on users their servers could handle so they could push past that to accomidate the potential hundreds of thousands of players that will be playing at one time. 

Comparasson Testing
The team used this testing for multiplayer. They could have up to 16 diffrent machines running the same lobby and while doing these tests would see how latency/lag plays a roll in the gameplay. For example they say how on one screen a bullet should have hit a headshot but on the player getting shot at it passes by their head on their screen. They could also see when a crash would happen and see why it happened on that machine. 

Useability Testing
The team would bring in people not affiliated with the company and watch them play through the level to see how much enjoyment they are getting and at which parts. Also checking to see which parts the player are getting frustrated with. An invaluable amount of information can be gathered by watching a random player play through the levels.

Playtesting
The team would bring in multiple people to play the same level to watch and get feedback on how they enjoy the game or where they are getting stuck. Very similar to useability testing but with more players involved.
