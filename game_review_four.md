## Summary
  Fortune Street is a party game created by the Dragon Quest series designer Yuji Horii. The franchise has many entries dating back to 1991, however Fortune Street has primarly been exclusive to Japan. The exceptions to this are the Nintendo Wii version that released in 2011 and a mobile version of the game. Fortune Street plays like the popular board game Monopoly where you use a die to move around the board, purchase property, and collect rent from the other players. Where Fortune Street seperates itself from monopoly is with the additions of a stock market, mini games, a level up feature, and a few other more complicated things. 

  Fortune Street allows you to play as Dragon Quest, Nintendo franchise, or your own Nintendo Mii sprites, however they are purely cosmetic and do not effect the game in any way. The objective of the game is to amass a net worth equal or higher to the specific game boards required amount. Once you have amassed the net worth you have to race back to the bank to claim victory.
  
   Now let's talk about how to get that net worth to the breakpoint. As I said before the game plays like monopoly in which there are color sets of properties you can collect by landing on them with no previous owner and buying them. What really spices up this game is the addition of a stock market. The color sets are broken up into "districts" for example the light blue properties may be "District A". Every district has a set market at the beginning of the game for their respective stocks, so district A may start at $10 per stock. Now why is this important you might ask, well the interesting thing about Fortune Street is you can invest into your properties even without owning all of one color. The more you invest the higher the rent becomes when an opponent lands on the space. You have to be smart about investing however, because when you invest money into a property there is a possibility that your investment will raise the price of the stocks. The game will notify you before you make the invesment if the stocks price will increase. Buying stocks for a specific district can also increase the price of the stock. From this you can see that if you by 20 stocks from district A at $10 a stock then increase the stock price to $11 a stock you just made $1 per stock. This is one of the main ways to win the game, so unlike monopoly even if you are having rotten luck collecting properties if you play the stock market right you still have a chance to win. 
   
   Fortune Street also has a level up system that helps advance the game. How this works is you travel the board collecting the four set icons I suppose you could call them. They are a heart, diamond, clover, and spade. You pass through the space to aquire the icon, once you have all four head back to the bank in the middle of the map for a level up that comes with a salary bonus that increases every time you level up. 


## Final Thoughts
  I love this game for the variety of stratagies you can use to play and win. The stock market and level up features really set the game apart from any other "board game" i've played. The stock market in particular is probably my favorite feature. The only issue I have with the game is there is a distinct learning curve that will take a new player around two games to really get down the unique features of the game, so a experienced player will have a distinct advantage over a new player.
