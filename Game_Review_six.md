## Summary
Ark is a member of the survival game genre. You have to manage things like food, water, temperature, etc. in a survival game. The fun thing about ark is the ability to build almost anywhere on the map you feel like. You can build buildings, storage, weapons, irrigation systems, crops/greenhouse, all sorts of things are at your disposal to build. What sets Ark apart from most of the other survival games is that there are wild dinosours roaming all across the lands. Some neutral to you and some hostile. The most fun part of Ark to me was the ability to tranqualize and tame these dinosaurs. Almost all the dinos in this game are tameable which will make them friendly towards you. You can ride a dino once it's been tamed, if you make the saddle that goes to the specifice dino. So you can use the dinos as a mode of transportation or gathering or fighting off other dinos that want to kill you or destroy your base. There are also a plethera of sea creatures in the game rainging from megalodons to jelly fish to Basilosaurus. There is a whole breeding thing you can do with your tamed dinos so you can try to breed extremly strong versions of said dino. It is quite a complicated subject though if you are trying to breed super Dinos. I reccommend to look up a guide about it if that is what you want to do. 

There is an objective to the game if you choose to pursue it. Most maps have objects called artifacts hidden throughout the land. The aftifacts are usually inside of caves that have many many hostile dinos patrolling them. Depending on what map you are playing on will depend on how many artifacts you need to collect. Once you have them all for the specific map you can place them in a terminal on the map. The terminals are marked by having giant collered structures above them so they are easy to find. Once you plug them in you and any dinos you brought with you that are standing on the platform will get transported to a new area where you will fight a boss. If you lose then too bad you wasted your time. If you win however you get access to "Tech". Think of tech as a set of futuristic items such as jetpacks, laser weapons, and even Tech saddles that turn your dinos into robots with laster cannons attatched to them. These things are purely optional and you don't have to go kill bosses if you don't want to and can just enjoy the game as a basic survival game. 

## Final Thoughts
I don't have much experience with survival games, however I can say with confidence that I enjoyed playing Ark very much. My favorite feature of the game was the ability to tame all sorts of diffrent dinos to enhance your experience with the game. The game was quite buggy while I played having crashed on me multiple times and dinos would sometimes clip through the environment.
