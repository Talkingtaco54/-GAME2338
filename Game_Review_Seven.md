### Rating
I rate on a scale of 1-5 stars.
This game recieves a 3 out of 5 stars. 


## Summary
This game is a simple runner game with simple controls. The extent of the controls is just movement and jumping. For the main mode of the game movement is automatic so you will always be moving forward. The game is fashioned in 8 - bit style with many nods or just straight rip offs from diffrent nintendo games. I saw enemies in this game similar to pac man ghosts, dragon quest slimes, and galaga enemies. Some of the music is the same, classic jingles from old nintendo games. 

The replayability factor of the game comes from collection of coins. Gathering mass amounts of coins allows the player to cash them in for a new playable character. The new playable characters from what I saw come with a new mechanic to aid the player in the game. Some of these abilities I saw were double jump, increased speed, and the ability to move back in forth instead of always forward. 

Where I was pleasantly suprised was the level editor. Very easy to use and understand. The level editor breaks the level down into a giant square grid whenre you can put any type of block, enemy, or coin in a single square space. Placing the blocks to create a playable area was very quick and seemless. The game allows you to test out your level as you build it without hassle. You can also upload your level and try out other peoples creations. 


## Final Thoughts
I found the main game mode of the game to be a little bland, however the level editor was a lot of fun to play around with.
