## Summary
  TrackMania Turbo is a classic take on arcade racers brought to the modern day. The game has a simplified control scheme with only three diffrent actions you can execute while driving. Accelerate, break, and restart race/checkpoint. I spent a majority of my time doing the pre made campaign tracks. TrackMania Turbo awards bronze, silver, or gold medals depending on your fastest track clear time. The tracks were very short and sweet lasting about thirty seconds per track, not counting the multi-lap couple of tracks I did. 

  Though the game offers simple controls the tracks can add quite a few challenges for the player. I ran into some tracks that had physical obsticles, boost pads, big jumps, tight curves, etc. There was even a track that had a boost pad going into a big jump, but the kicker was you need to slow down before the jump to successfuly fly through the mid air passage. Going too fast or too slow will make you clip the wall and crash down into the water ruining your track time. 
  
  I spend time designing one unique track with the games custom track builder. TrackMania Turbo has plenty to offer for the creative player in terms of sections of track to use. what is unique about this game is that building a track is not just ground level horizontal building. you can actually build vertically to achieve all sorts of unique outcomes. The track builder was very easy to use with examples of pieces of track being shown to you as you build. I was able to quickly switch from build mode to testing mode without any load times which was great. You can choose from any time of day for your track, and select between diffrent styles of environment. There is even more experinced bulding modes that I didn't use much since I stuck with beginner builder mode. 

## Final Thoughts
  I am indifferent when it comes to the racing genre, but I can honestly say I enjoyed my time playing TrackMania Turbo. My favorite feature of the game would probably be the way the game shows "ghost data". What I mean by that is you can select which medal you are aiming to achieve and the game will have a ghost car running the track along side you showing you what rate of completion you need to achieve to get the gold. The game also generates the ghost of your car on the path of the fastest time you achieved on the track. 
 
 I had some sort of skipping issue at the starts of almost every track where for about half a second the game would freeze then resume as if it never froze for that half second. I'm playing on a PS4 pro, so I doubt it's my hardware that was the issue. That was the only thing I disliked about my time playing TrackMania Turbo.
