**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ From the start the controls are not stated anywhere and expect the player to find out how to move through controller input exploration. Object of the game is not understandable until playing through the game once. A playthrough will take only 10 min. This game is the type of game that has the same start point everytime but diffrent paths you can take every time you play.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ no, I felt like any theme or any mechanics could be switched out with this game and it wouldn't change much.
