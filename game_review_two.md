## Summary
  This game is another FPS in the Battle Royal family. Apex is a free to play game made by EA games. The game plays on 1 map with up to 60 players in teams of three. There are now ten diffrent characters to pick from with diffrent unique "kits". The characters have a class tier such as support, offensive, and defensive. Every character has a passive ability, a tactical ability, and a ultimate ability. The passive ability is usually always active, but may have a condition that needs to be met to activate. For example the character Bangalore's passive gives her a hefty speed boost when she is shot at by opposing players. The tactical ability for the characters is a user activatable ability that has a cooldown once used (cooldown length is diffrent depending on the character). The ultimate ability is unique to the character ability that can change the battle in your favor. The ultimate ability needs to charge to 100% to be able to use, which will charge passively over time or with the use of a pick up item you can find on the map.
  
  When the game begins every player is in a drop ship and can pick when to deploy. You then can glide down to a location of your choosing and begin the game. When you land you will have no weapons and will need to scour the map for weapons, health, ammo, attatchments for weapons, grenades, and items. Diffrent weapons require diffrent types of ammo so communication with your team to get the types of pickups you need is very important. 
  
  The objective of the game is to be the last team standing on the map. Over periods of time a ring will appear on the map and start shrinking periodically. If you are outside the ring you will take damage so this forces teams to approach each other so the game will not drag on for too long. 

  

## Final Thoughts
As a free to play experience I felt that the game was well made and had a lot of fun playing. I feel the game suffers from lack of replayability. There isn't much incentive to keep playing apart from growing your character game stats and unlocking levels with the game pass which only rewards some lame cosmetic items.
