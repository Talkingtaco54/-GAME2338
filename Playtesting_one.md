**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The game does a good job using a overly extended tutorial for my prefrecnces to explain the rules of the game. With a pop up screen you can read and slide to additional pages. This helps a new player learn what everything does.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Honestly for the time I spent on the game everything seemed to have a suitable place. The tutorial could have an option for a shorter version for players more familar with the genre of game.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ At the beginning levels yes the game is balanced, however it seems like the more you play and level up the more difficult the missions and events will become. Prompting the player to spend in game resources as well as real world money to try and recruit new units to help get over the hump. These games typically target the casual audience. 

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Yes an rts style gameplay is a more high stress way to play a game and that matches what this type of game is perfectly.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Very much so. The app is littered with refrences to the anime/manga. All of the gameplay combat uses the characters from the show and they fight as they do in the show. The game uses a rts style deployment system which can give that sense of anticipation which is what the show does while watching. 

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ yes, I enjoyed playing the game. I haven't been the biggest fan of the show, but I was still able to have fun while learning the mechanics and playing through the levels. 

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ With the few hours I spent with the game I found no issues. I tried to swap through menus rapidly to see if it would crash and it held up well.
