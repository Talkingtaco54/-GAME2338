### Rating
I rate this game a solid 9/10 stars.

## Summary
  
  It's been eight long years since the last major Dragon Quest was released in the west, was the wait worth it?
  
  DQXI follows the heroes journey template to a tee. The game puts the player into the life of "The Hero" what seems to be a ordinary young man until his coming of age ceremony where an event will happen to awaken his hidden untapped power. The power he will come to find out is the power of the legendary Luminary, but with the awakening of this great power of light brings forth a great power of darkness to combat it. Thus the call to adventure begins when the heroes journey to find answers about his power begins and he sets out into the world.  
 
 DQXI takes place in a fantasy world named Erdrea where magic, monsters, and kingdoms are commonplace. Exploring the vast world of Erdrea packed full with colorful characters and a variety of diffrent monsters had me not wanting to put the controller down. Speaing of the characters for DQXI new players to the Dragon Quest franchise may find the look of the characters a bit familiar. The reason for this is Dragon Quest has had a long standing partnershit with Akira Toriyama on the character designs. Akira Toriyama best known for his Dragon Ball series has had his character designs and art style become a huge appeal to the Dragon Quest franchise. DQXI is no diffrent with Toriyamas trademark art style prominent in the game.  
 
 The combat system for DQXI follows the same turn based battle sequence fans of the franchise grew up on. The player can use magic and weapon skills to dispatch a monster. The game follows a experience gain leveling system. Defeat monsters, gain exp, level up and become more powerful. When you level up you obtain "Skill Points" you use these SP to learn new more powerful attacks. A new feature was added to the combat with the "Free Form" option. What "free form" does is it allows the player to free roam in a cirular pattern around the monster during battle. This feature has no effect on the current battle in terms of attack order or hidden damage boosts. In conclusion free form was implemnted for the fans to take some interesting photos and explore fighting a monster from a diffrent angle.
 

## Final Thoughts
  Overall I loved playing this game. The traditional turn based jrpg style combat has always been very enjoyable to myself personally. I can say I put in over 100 hours into this game to complete everything. The Dragon Quest XI story if very enjoyable and well delivered. The load times for the game were a bit on the long side which may disengage some from the game.
