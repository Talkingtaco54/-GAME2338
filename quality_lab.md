notes
Halo 2 - reusability - halo 2 has great reusability, because the game has multiple game modes, custom games that are fully customizable. 
Diffrent difficulties and modifiers.

Minecraft - Interoperability - minecraft handles cross play really well between pc, xbox, and switch. 

Mario Party 4 - Correctness - i've played a bunch of mario party 4, probably over 70 hours. I can say for certain that the game runs as intended and I have never run into any issues with bugs/errors.
