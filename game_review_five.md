## Summary
Frost is a mix of survival game and deck building game. You play as the leader of a tribe trying to survive a relentless snow storm. The objective of the game is to complete requirments for travel to move closer to safety, however every turn in the game that you are unable to fulfill the requirments the snow storm moves one step closer. Their are resources in the game to manage such as people, food, lumber, weapons, etc. On the journey to safety you may come across obsticles such as wolves, cannibals, food shortage, etc. 

The first thing that I discovered while playing is how easy it is to pick up and play. It won't take you long to learn the basics of the game at all which is nice for a game that on the surface sound complex. Depending on the scenario selected you will start with a preset ten card deck that has wood, food, survivors, and occasionaly despair cards. Despair cards are basically dead cards in your hand that do nothing at all. You aquire these cards typically as a penalty for multiple things that could happen on your journey. To get rid of these cards you need to pass your turn without doing anything to "Trash" every despair card in your current hand. Every turn you draw 5 cards from your deck and can use the resources of that hand to purchase better cards to add to the deck per area you camp at. These cards can have things that let you draw more cards when they are played, some may have a value of multiple food as opposed to the basic food cards you start with that are worth one each. Every area will have an objective you feed resources into such as 2 people, 0 wood, and 1 food. Once you feed in the requirments you move to the next camp and can continue to improve your deck. Typically you need to advance 10 times to make it to safety. Be warned every turn you do not advance to the next camp the "Storm" moves closer. Typically the storm starts 5 turns behind you giving you a little breathing room, this can change depending on played scenario. The game even offers custom modifiers for the more hardcore players that want to make their journey even more harsh and brutal. 

There have been many addons to the game with new mechanics and cards. Some of these cards are double edged swords however, they may give you a despair card to gain a very useful and powerful card. The replayability of the game is there since most games don't take too long depending on your skill level with remembering the cards and makeing good choices. You can also unlock new cards for completing scenarios which gives you that urge to complete them all to get those strong cards added to the RNG pull for your next game. 

## Final Thoughts
My favorite feature of Frost is how it hooks you immediately with it's simple learning curve and it's straightforward rules on winning. My only issue with the game is that it is possible to be put into an unwinnable situation since the requirments to move to next camp are randomized. It could take multiple turns to get that perfect hand to move on to the next area, but by then you may have lost too much time and the storm catching you is inevitable.
